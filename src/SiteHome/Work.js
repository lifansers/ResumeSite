<br/>    <b>SunSPOT Technologies LLC
<br/>    <i>Technician</i></b>
<br/>    <i>June - August 2018 </i>
<br/>    The researchers working with SunSPOT discovered a procedure that has the potential to prevent many fatalities due to kidney transplant complications. SunSPOTs goal is to automate that procedure to create an organ transplant evaluation system.
<br/>
<br/>    I tested and debugged the machine prototype to make the process precise and accurate.
<br/> To do that, I learned and exectuted the kidney evaluation procedure by hand to compare the process and data, and adjusted the machine to operate as close to that as possible.
<br/>
<br/>    I also reduced the procedure time for machine operation by redesigning portions of the user interface to make machine commands more accessible.
